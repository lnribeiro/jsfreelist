This is a list of websites that work without JS. Feel free to contribute!

To browse the internet without javascript, we recommend:

**Disable Javascript** [[Firefox]](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disable-javascript/) [[Chrome]](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-javascript/jfpdlihdedhlmhlbgooailmfhahieoem): Most user-friendly option, but less efficient. Recommended for users who want zero headaches because they don't want permanent whitelists and blacklists, so a site either works without js or must be whitelisted temporarily, bad code et al. Go to options, turn **Default state** as **JS Off** and **Disable behavior** by **By tab**.

**LibreJS** [[Firefox]](https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/): Blocks nonfree nontrivial javascript while allowing opensource and simple codes to run, avoiding a lot of trouble without breaking many sites. For advanced users that want more control or casual users who don't want to don't want a lot of stress and still have full freedom.

**NoScript** [[Firefox]](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/) [[Chrome]](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noscript/doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm): Works better on Firefox. Blocks javascript, flash and other executable content. Extremely powerful heavy use of white/blacklisting for advanced users, but also very user-friendly if you have the patience to understand and use it.
